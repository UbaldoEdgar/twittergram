# Twittergram
A new way to browse tweets from specific users, focused on image content!

<h2>FEATURES</h2>

There are two options for viewing Tweets from twitter!

<b>Firstly</b>, you can pull tweet images using a user's twitter handle! This will display any images from their timeline (including retweets).

You are able to keep loading more tweets from their timeline until it reaches either the request limit set by twitter (this will take a while) or until there are no more tweets to pull from!

<b>Secondly</b>, you can pull tweets from a Twitter List using the id located in the url. Twitter Lists is a good idea but it does not have a media tab so if you are trying to browse a list of users and want to ignore non-media tweets, this will work well.

You can click on any image to inspect it closer (in a slideshow) and download any image as well!

<h2>HOW TO USE</h2>

To use this, you have to run the command  <b>npm install</b> in <b>BOTH</b> directories (twitlist/backend) to install the dependencies!

Then, you need to setup your Twitter Keys/Tokens (generate them here http://developer.twitter.com/) inside the .env file in the backend directory.

Finally, you want to run the server/backend and the twitlist app/frontend. Run the command <b>npm run dev</b> inside the backend directory and the command <b>npm start</b> inside the twitlist directory!
